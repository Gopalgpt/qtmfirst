Feature: User Login

  As a registered user
  I want to log into the application
  So that I can access my dashboard

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter a valid username
    And I enter a valid password
    And I click the "Login" button
    Then I should be redirected to the dashboard
    And I should see a welcome message

  Scenario: Unsuccessful login with invalid password
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter a valid username
    And I enter an invalid password
    And I click the "Login" button
    Then I should see an error message saying "Invalid credentials"
